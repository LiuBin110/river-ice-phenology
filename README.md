# river-ice-phenology
Code for river ice phenology identification based on remote sensing

## Google Earth Engine Scripts

All main scripts used in this study are available in the `GEE_Scripts` folder:
- `1_river_mask_extraction.txt`: River channel mask extraction
- `2_sample_selection.txt`: Sample selection for ice/water
- `3_rf_model_training.txt`: Random Forest model training
- `4_ice_extraction.txt`: Automated river ice extraction

All scripts are in plain text for easy copy and use in the GEE code editor.

### ice_ratio_data.zip

This file contains the river ice cover ratio time series data (2013â€“2023) extracted using the scripts provided in this repository. Each CSV file represents the ice cover ratio for a specific river segment and year, generated by automated remote sensing and classification algorithms in Google Earth Engine.
